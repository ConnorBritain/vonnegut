# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository's bundles.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Bundles version
independently; each entry names the bundle it belongs to. The version recorded here is the
one in that bundle's four manifests and its `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` entry, which
must agree.

**A note on what appears here.** A primitive that is authored but **held** (`ships: false`
in its `meta.yaml`, no rendered copy under `bundles/*/agents/`) is not a release and does
not get a version. It appears under *Unreleased* with its hold reason, because a reader
deciding whether to install a bundle should be able to see what is being worked on and why
it is not yet in their hands.

---

## Unreleased

- **Added** a durable roadmap — [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md), one spec per
  item under `docs/roadmap/`, and a `STATUS.md` checklist that is now the single
  pin for bundle versions — plus `tools/check-roadmap.mjs`, run first by
  `node tools/check.mjs`, which fails when a manifest version, the marketplace
  entry, this file or the roadmap's status fields disagree with `STATUS.md`. No
  bundle version changes.

No new behavior release is introduced by the repository split. Historical entries
labelled local candidates describe their status at the time of recording.

## Vonnegut extraction — 2026-09-10

- Copied the writing-only toolkit from agent-primitives commit `052a54a`:
  prose-author 0.6.0, prose-review 0.3.0 and prose-tell-scan 0.1.1.
- Changed repository and marketplace identity to `ConnorBritain/vonnegut` / `vonnegut`.
- Preserved primitive names, prompt bodies, bundle versions, historical evidence
  and shared writing-memory paths. Excluded unrelated engineering agents and Actions.
- Added standalone packaging checks, local verification entrypoint and migration guidance.

## prose-outline

### [0.1.0] — outlines, implied outlines, diffs and a per-project store

Roadmap item A ([`docs/roadmap/A-prose-outline.md`](docs/roadmap/A-prose-outline.md));
release notes in [`RELEASE-v0.1.0.md`](bundles/prose-outline/RELEASE-v0.1.0.md).

- **Added** the bundle: four manifests, marketplace entry, README, AGENTS.md,
  PROTOCOL.md, DESIGN.md, wiring snippets and a selftest wired into
  `node tools/check.mjs`.
- **Added** `lib/text-index.mjs`, the canonical segmentation core (headings,
  paragraphs, sentences, capitalised runs, defined terms, numbers and dates, all
  with exact source offsets and lines), with three parity cases whose expected
  JSON is generated output, and a cross-implementation check that its locations
  agree with tell-scan, visible-prose and fidelity-scan on shared text.
- **Added** `lib/registry-reader.mjs` (read-only `voice-identity-registry/1`
  access returning the three states `none | ambiguous | selected`, plus
  `PROSE_PROJECTS_DIR` resolution) and `lib/revision-store.mjs` (the
  [`docs/registry-stores.md`](docs/registry-stores.md) contract: immutable
  revisions, atomic pointer, exclusive lock, undo as a new revision, and an
  approval gate that returns a proposal instead of writing). Registry fixtures
  are written by prose-author's own writer, and the selftest pins reader and
  digest parity against it.
- **Added** `outline-scan.mjs`: heading tree, per-section words and ratio to the
  median, two topic-sentence candidates per paragraph, claim-marker counts by
  word class, opening transition markers and lexical links at every paragraph
  boundary, and a `not-evaluated` refusal for a heading-free note. Seven
  fixtures (an essay, a reference doc, a fiction chapter, two revisions of one
  post, a note, and a byte-identical corpus post) with generated expected JSON.
- **Added** the `voice-outline/1` schema (argument and beat-sheet modes as one
  node vocabulary, stable node ids, evidence slots on claims) and
  `outline-diff.mjs`, which compares two revisions by id only — added,
  removed, moved, reparented, reworded, evidence filled — and never matches by
  text, with a fixture pair and generated expected output.
- **Added** `outline-store.mjs`: `locate`, `show`, `list`, `save` and `undo`
  over `<projects>/<identity>/<project>/outlines`, refusing to persist with no
  registry or with identities and no default (exit 3, never picking the
  first), returning a proposal without `--approved`, and refusing stale
  revisions and invalid proposals before touching disk. Eleven mutations for
  these guards are registered in the repo's mutation runner under a new
  `outline` suite.
- **Added** the `prose-outline` skill (SKILL.md, meta.yaml, a readable schema
  reference) with argument and beat-sheet modes, and `proposal-check.mjs`,
  which enforces the skill's two promises mechanically: a concrete brief yields
  a thesis and a slot on every claim; an underspecified brief yields open
  questions and a null thesis, never an invented one. The schema now refuses a
  null thesis with no open question. Brief fixtures, example proposals and a
  harness note record how real runs are dispatched and checked; no run was
  dispatched in this environment.

## prose-review

### [0.4.0] — in progress

Roadmap item B ([`docs/roadmap/B-prose-structure-critic.md`](docs/roadmap/B-prose-structure-critic.md));
deliverables land one at a time against [`docs/roadmap/STATUS.md`](docs/roadmap/STATUS.md).

- **Added** `prose-structure-critic` (primitive + byte-identical bundle copy):
  a clean-context reviewer of a draft's argument — order, transitions,
  unsupported claims, balance — read from `outline-scan` JSON and, when the
  writer has one, the intended outline. Two stated modes with opposite
  tie-breaks. Registered in the Claude manifest and the Codex installer;
  `DESIGN.md`'s table records the territory it takes from the unshipped
  adversarial reader and substance critic.

### [0.3.0]

- **Added** `prose-reviser`, under a log-only contract: it emits an edit log rather than
  rewritten prose, so every change is inspectable before it is applied.
- **Added** `prose-fidelity-critic`, closing the review flywheel — a revision can now be
  checked for information loss, not only for voice.
- **Changed** the run harness to be re-runnable, with recorded verdicts recomputed from
  artefacts rather than trusted.

### [0.1.0]

- **Added** `prose-voice-critic` — judges a draft against an author's corpus directly,
  and a harness for measuring whether a prompt change actually moved the verdicts.

---

## prose-tell-scan

### [0.1.1]

- **Fixed** calibration blending so approved samples cannot dominate the pool past the
  cap, and cannot be blended in below the human-sample floor on a cold start.

### [0.1.0]

- **Added** `tell-scan` — scans prose for AI tells against a calibrated corpus rather
  than a fixed list, so the bands move with the author's own writing.

---

## prose-author

### [0.6.0] — shared writing identities

- **Added** a harness-independent `voice-identity-registry/1` outside plugin
  installations, pointing to shared corpora, pinned profiles, preferences and
  numerical history. Defaults require explicit selection; one-off jobs can opt out.
- **Added** immutable registry/profile revisions, atomic pointer updates,
  exclusive writer locks and stale-revision rejection. Incompatible versions,
  unavailable registered corpora and changed pinned profile bytes fail explicitly.
- **Integrated** identity resolution into drafting, profile preparation, tuning
  and history commands. Runs snapshot resolved inputs; old receipts do not read
  newer identity state. Existing explicit-path workflows remain available.
- **Preserved** independent preferences and undo across profile publication,
  opt-in history/rhetoric, distinct provenance and historical artifacts. No native
  Pi/Devin model adapter, multi-machine sync or automatic corpus ingestion added.

### [0.5.0] — local candidate, unpublished

- **Added** opt-in numbers-only history with per-piece rhythm and punctuation
  measurements, compatible contextual baselines, temporal summaries, pinned
  references, export, disablement and preview-bound deletion.
- **Added** independently usable `voice-rhetoric-measure` and separately enabled,
  bounded rhetorical estimates. Raw annotations are not retained in history.
- **Preserved** independent human evidence, revision/duplicate accounting and
  explicit preferences. Generated writing never becomes a human baseline;
  statistical departures are not automatic quotas or repair instructions.
- **Verified** exact-byte stage comparisons, native Claude/Codex installation,
  loose files and all local engineering gates, including 266 caught mutations.
  Fixed a timestamp-dependent mutation probe without changing production code
  or assertions; the original failed check remains recorded.
- **Recorded** twelve locked rhetorical draws without redraws. Structural validity
  is not semantic accuracy. Both corrected installed workflows have passing
  artifact audits, while Claude's chat-summary labeling failure remains visible.
- **Limits** collection remains off for real writing until enabled; English
  segmentation is heuristic, rhetoric is model-estimated, and neither establishes
  writing quality or resemblance. See [completion evidence](bundles/prose-author/tests/V050-FINAL-ENGINEERING.md).

### [0.4.0] — local candidate, unpublished

- **Verified** authoritative generated-file delivery in fresh Claude and Codex
  sessions. Chat summaries remain unverified; direct receipt excerpts must match
  their source. `check-result --delivery` detects prose or receipt changes.
- **Recorded** all local engineering gates passing, including 245 mutation
  update/check cases, with original failed experiments and known limits retained.

- **Changed** observed frequencies from compulsory quotas to advisory per-document
  tendencies. Added independent explicit phrase, punctuation, length and count rules.
- **Fixed** visible-prose measurement so link destinations, metadata and code do
  not inflate author counts. Rules use actual final length, exact zero limits and
  explicit not-evaluated states.
- **Added** profile/3, preferences/2 and style-spec/2, preserving historical readers
  and scoring. Short attributable samples count; sparse evidence stays limited.
- **Added** an authenticated Claude/Codex production runtime with task-scaled review,
  exact-byte receipts, selected whole human examples, profile-only mode and at most
  two repairs that retain original style inputs.
- **Added** generated human-readable delivery receipts and separate receipt-integrity
  verification that preserves failed or unevaluated check statuses. Host permission
  denials remain explicitly ungated; no sandbox bypass is automatic.
- **Added** persistent scoped corrections, shared store discovery, immutable history,
  undo and small-batch discovery/comparison. Direct persistent instructions save with
  receipts; inferred preferences require approval. No human attestation is required.
- **Preserved** rewriting and added passage-context continuation without automatically
  ingesting generated text into a human corpus.
- **Documented** the Pi adapter interface; implementation remains deferred. Companion
  bundle versions are unchanged because their contracts are unchanged.
- **Evaluation** uses a bounded two-author, three-form, three-condition comparison,
  not a renewed 20/60 release bar. Current evidence and known limits are
  recorded in [V040-PROGRESS.md](bundles/prose-author/tests/V040-PROGRESS.md).

### [0.3.0]

- **Added** `prose-style-tune`, a headless discovery, feedback, versioning, scoping,
  diff, compilation, and controlled-comparison workflow over immutable `voice-profile/2`
  evidence.
- **Added** `voice-feedback-interpret`, a read-only planner that translates one direct,
  discovery, or pairwise feedback event into a reviewable proposal. It cannot edit the
  profile or apply its own operations.
- **Added** deterministic `voice-preferences/1`, `voice-preference-proposal/1`, and
  `voice-style-spec/1` contracts with canonical digests, parent ancestry, explicit operation
  acceptance, stale-profile refusal, five-axis scopes, conflict refusal, and context-specific
  compilation.
- **Changed** `voice-draft` and its deterministic control/target cards to accept a compiled
  style specification while preserving the profile-only path. Recountable user-supplied
  controls can override named measured targets without rewriting the observed profile.
- **Documented** the repository split boundary: semantic contracts remain primitives;
  persistent corpus/project/UI state belongs in a future Style Studio product repository.

### [0.2.1]

- **Added** a conditional whole-paragraph residual-prune boundary for an overlong
  semantic revision. A corpus-blind planner selects paragraph IDs; deterministic
  code restores an explicitly locked title, normalizes an excess question mark
  on a Markdown heading, applies deletions, and recounts the complete result.
- **Added** a portable `schema` / `prompt` / `apply` CLI and routed the shipped
  `prose-draft` blank-page workflow through it only for the narrow supported case.
- **Verified** the exact immutable v0.2.0 m05 failure: the first two full-rewrite
  correction canaries remained overlong, while the bounded prune canary passed
  at 737 words with every semantic-bearing count in range. This targeted evidence
  is not represented as a fresh 20-draft acceptance run.

### [0.2.0]

- **Added** `voice-profile-render`, which converts a single-author corpus into cited
  semantic findings for deterministic `voice-profile/2` assembly. The profile covers ten
  fixed dimensions and keeps count/rate arithmetic out of the model's hands.
- **Added** `voice-draft`, a corpus-blind blank-page drafter. It receives only the request
  and rendered profile; Claude Code ships it with an empty tool allowlist.
- **Added** deterministic target compilation, semantic conformance measurement, bounded
  exact patches, and an independent factual-basis disclosure/rejection stage. These make
  unsupported claims visible; they do not guarantee factual accuracy.
- **Changed** `prose-draft` to choose between the original passage-rewrite path and the new
  blank-page path, and to label results UNGATED when `prose-tell-scan` or `prose-review`
  is unavailable.
- **Packaged** both agents for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, generic plugin discovery, and
  loose-file installation without changing their canonical prompt bodies.
- **Evaluated** the release on two modern licensed corpora. Six fresh profiles validated;
  19/20 semantic revisions met every measured band; both underdetermined prompts refused.
  One revision retained one excess question and the run stopped before claim audits and
  critics. This known limitation is documented for v0.2.1 rather than hidden behind a
  resemblance, quality, detector, or factual-accuracy claim.

### [0.1.0]

- **Added** the `prose-draft` skill — scoped generation with two refusal paths, and edit
  ingestion as the correction channel.
