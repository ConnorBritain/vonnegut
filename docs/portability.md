# Portability

What survives the trip between harnesses, and what doesn't.

## The substrate

Markdown with YAML frontmatter is the common format. Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Kimi all
read agent definitions in that shape, and `name` + `description` are near-universal keys.
**The prompt body ports at essentially 100%.**

That's the good news, and it's why one source of truth is viable at all.

## What doesn't port

Enforcement.

| Property | Claude Code | Cursor | Codex | AGENTS.md only |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runs in a **separate context** from the caller | ✅ real subagent | ⚠️ weaker | ⚠️ via `codex exec` | ❌ same context |
| **Tool restrictions** enforced (`tools:` allowlist) | ✅ harness-enforced | ⚠️ partial | ❌ prose only | ❌ prose only |
| Can **block the turn** | ✅ Stop hook | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Model pinned** | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Prompt body | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

Read it as a ladder, not a checklist. Each rung you lose degrades the primitive in a specific,
predictable way:

**Lose separate context** and the agent shares the history of whoever produced the work — with
all its justifications pre-loaded.

**Lose the tool allowlist** and "read-only" becomes a request. An agent that *can* act on what
it finds generally will.

**Lose turn-blocking** and any rule about when the primitive must run becomes a suggestion.

## How much it costs depends on the kind

This is the part worth getting right, because the answer is not uniform.

**reviewer — severe.** Context isolation *is* the mechanism. A critic reviewing work it argued
itself into will approve it, and the read-only guarantee is what stops it from quietly fixing
instead of reporting. On an advisory-only harness a reviewer keeps its checklist and loses its
independence, which is most of its value. Treat an advisory reviewer as a linting aid, not a
gate.

**transformer — moderate.** The rewrite still happens correctly; the prompt carries the method.
What degrades is the boundary: `preserves` and `scope: selection` stop being guarantees and
become intentions, so a transformer told to touch only the prose in a document may reformat the
code blocks too. Mitigate by narrowing the input rather than trusting the constraint — pass the
selection, don't pass the file and describe the selection.

**author — moderate.** Output quality holds. What you lose is the assurance that it only wrote
where it was supposed to. Review the file list.

Bundle-specific adapters must distinguish deterministic checks from partial
context restriction and semantic judgment. The current `prose-author` candidate
implements authenticated Claude/Codex CLI adapters, portable preferences and
exact-final-byte checks; selected whole human examples are optional authorized
inputs. It does not claim general read isolation or a native Pi adapter. See its
[runtime and adapter contract](../bundles/prose-author/RUNTIME.md) for precise
boundaries and unavailable-check behavior. Historical corpus-blind runs retain
their original meaning rather than being relabeled as current evidence.
The shared identity registry is independent of these transports: compatible
local installations can use the same corpus/profile pointers, preferences and
opt-in numerical store. Local locks are not multi-machine synchronization.

**investigator — mild.** Read-only is a natural fit for the task rather than a constraint being
fought, and there's no verdict anyone has an incentive to skip. Ports nearly intact.

**planner — mild.** Same reason. The plan is the artifact; nothing about it needs enforcement.

So the question isn't "does this port?" but "which rung does this kind actually stand on?" A
reviewer that loses context isolation has lost the argument. An investigator hasn't noticed.

### A second axis, inside a kind: can the recipient check the finding?

The rows above are per kind, but two primitives of the same kind can degrade differently, and the
thing that separates them is whether their output can be adjudicated by the person reading it —
the [ground-truth question](../CONTRIBUTING.md#ground-truth-and-what-you-may-claim-without-it).

Where findings are checkable, an advisory port degrades to a checklist the user audits item by
item; the harness guaranteed nothing, but nothing was being taken on trust either. Where they are
not, the same port degrades to an opinion with a verdict token attached — and the token is the
part that travels. Losing enforcement costs more than the kind's row suggests, because enforcement
was the only thing standing behind a claim nobody can independently test.

The mitigation is portable, which is why it's worth naming here: **require every finding to quote
the evidence it rests on.** That rule lives in the prompt, so it survives every rung of the
ladder, and it converts an unverifiable verdict into something the reader can at least argue with.

## Recovering what you can

- **Fresh subprocess.** `codex exec` (or equivalent) with the input piped in recovers context
  isolation, the rung that usually matters most. Tool restriction and blocking remain
  unavailable; state them in the prompt and accept that they're honour-system.
- **New session, paste the input.** Manual, works everywhere, honest.
- **CI.** The durable fallback for anything gate-shaped: clean context by construction, and it
  can genuinely block a merge. Later feedback than a Stop hook, but real enforcement, and it
  works regardless of which harness the author was using.
- **Narrow the input.** For transformers and authors, the most reliable way to enforce scope on
  a harness that can't is to hand over less.

## Design consequence

Primitives declare the **contract** they need separately from the per-harness metadata that may
or may not deliver it. See any `primitives/agents/*/meta.yaml`:

```yaml
contract:
  read_only: true
  clean_context: true
  scope: diff

harness:
  claude-code: { enforcement: enforced, ... }
  codex:       { enforcement: advisory, ... }
```

`enforcement` is the honest label: `enforced`, `partial`, or `advisory`. When the generator
lands it reads this to emit each target, and keeps the tables above accurate.

Say the degradation out loud in user-facing docs. An `advisory` port described as `enforced` is
worse than no port, because it buys false confidence in exactly the place where the point was
to stop trusting the agent's self-report.
