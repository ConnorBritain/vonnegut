/**
 * fetch-professional — vendor EFF Deeplinks posts as a MODERN PROFESSIONAL
 * register sample. CC-BY 4.0.
 *
 *   node tests/corpus/fetch-professional.mjs             # dry run
 *   node tests/corpus/fetch-professional.mjs --write     # fetch + write
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THIS IS NOT A VOICE CORPUS, AND THE DIRECTORY NAME IS THE WARNING
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * It writes to `human-professional/`, NOT to `human-essays/`, and the split is
 * load-bearing rather than cosmetic.
 *
 * `human-essays/` holds SINGLE IDENTIFIABLE AUTHORS with enough samples each
 * to characterise one person's cadence. Everything that reasons about voice -
 * calibrating a profile, the voice critic's cross-author test - depends on
 * "these samples were written by the same human" being true.
 *
 * Deeplinks is written by EFF's staff: the feed carries ~27 named authors
 * across 50 posts, so no author clears the 15-sample floor and never will at
 * this cadence. Averaging them produces a house style, not a person. Filed
 * with `human/` (multi-author Wikipedia) in kind, and kept out of the
 * single-author set for the same reason `human/` is.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. Register coverage. `human-essays/` reaches argument (Bacon,
 * Chesterton), correspondence (Chekhov), narration (Chopin, O. Henry) and
 * modern long-form (Doctorow); `human/` reaches encyclopedic. None of them
 * reaches contemporary professional advocacy - the register of a policy post
 * or a campaign explainer, which is edited prose with a house voice, a call to
 * action, and a deadline. That register is what a lot of real drafting
 * actually is, and until now nothing measured it.
 *
 * ONE OVERLAP WORTH KNOWING. Cory Doctorow appears in this feed and also has
 * his own single-author tranche in `human-essays/pluralistic/`. Anything doing
 * cross-author work must draw from one bucket, not both, or it will score an
 * author against himself and call the result a match.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * LICENSING - the evidence, not a summary of it
 * ============================================================================

 *    distributed at will under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
 *    International License (CC-BY), unless otherwise noted. All material that

 *    to redistribute."
 *
 * Deeplinks posts are original EFF material. The two caveats are real and are
 * handled: "unless otherwise noted" is why the fetcher refuses any post whose
 * body carries a competing licence or copyright line (see REFUSALS below), and
 * "not original to EFF" is why block quotations are kept but nothing is
 * vendored from a post that is mostly reprinted third-party text.
 *
 * The bar is unchanged from the sibling fetchers: public domain, CC0, CC-BY,
 * or CC-BY-SA only. If the licence cannot be quoted, the source does not land.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * LINK TARGETS - changed 2026-08-06, and the committed corpus PREDATES it
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Deeplinks cites by hyperlinking. This extractor used to keep the anchor text
 * and throw the href away, so a vendored post read as a run of unsourced
 * assertions and a critic that said so was right about our file and wrong
 * about the article. Links are now kept as markdown `[text](url)`; the
 * reasoning is at the replacement in extractBody().
 *
 * EVERY .txt CURRENTLY COMMITTED WAS FETCHED BEFORE THAT CHANGE and still has
 * its targets stripped. Those files therefore carry `link_targets: stripped`
 * in their frontmatter, added as a disclosure rather than a repair, because
 * the treatment is a property of the file and not of the calendar.
 *
 * THEY ARE NOT RE-FETCHED HERE, AND THE REASON IS NOT COST. The source is an
 * RSS feed of the ~50 most recent posts, not an archive: re-running --write
 * does not re-fetch these 50 posts, it fetches WHATEVER 50 ARE CURRENT AND
 * DELETES THE REST. That silently swaps the sample set underneath every figure
 * measured on it. A re-fetch is the right way to get link targets into this
 * bucket and it should be done deliberately, as its own change, with the
 * corpus diff reviewed and anything baselined against the old set re-measured
 * - not as a side effect of a test run. Tests never fetch; the corpus is
 * committed.

  //    THIS USED TO DROP THE HREF, and dropping it was a measurement bug rather than a

  //    opinion, "researchers found" links to the paper. Strip the target and the vendored
  //    sample reads as a string of confident unsourced assertions - which is the exact
  //    shape of `absence-of-concrete-detail` and the unnamed-source half of
  //    `invented-specifics`. Every EFF sample in a false-positive sweep was therefore
  //    handed to the critic with its citations removed, and any finding the critic made
  //    about missing support was a finding about our extractor. The confound was known
  //    and declared per fixture (selftest.mjs, STRIPS_LINKS); declaring a defect is not
  //    the same as not having it.
  //
  //    WHY MARKDOWN AND NOT A FOOTNOTE LIST. The citation has to sit where the claim
  //    sits, because what the critic is judging is whether THIS sentence is supported. A
  //    list at the foot restores the URLs and not the association.
  //
  //    THE COST, STATED. URLs now count as tokens, so cadence figures over this bucket
