tell-scan — deterministic writing-tell and cadence scan (report-only)

  node tell-scan.mjs <file...> [options]

Options
  --profile <name>      Force a register profile. Otherwise resolved per file:
                        frontmatter → path rule → default → _base.
  --baseline <file>     Compare against a prior version; reports before/after
                        densities and flags any newly introduced tell.
  --allow <a,b,c>       Extra allowlist terms for this run.
  --profiles-dir <dir>  Profile directory to search before the project's and
                        the bundle's.
  --project <dir>       Project root (for .claude/humanizer.json). Default: cwd.
  --json                Machine-readable output.
  --all                 List every below-threshold hit, not just the first 12.
  --no-examples         Omit matched-text examples.
  --plain               Treat input as plain text (skip markdown masking).
  --markdown            Force markdown masking.
  --relative            "Is this me?" Compare against YOUR measured rates
                        rather than severity ceilings. Needs a calibrated
                        corpus; refuses without one.
  --human-only          Judge catalog density against bands derived ONLY from
                        prose you wrote unaided, ignoring approved edits. The
                        default is to use the blended bands when calibrate has
                        produced them. Cadence bands are human-only either way,
                        always, and no flag changes that.
  --show-bands          Print human-only and blended ceilings side by side, so
                        the drift between them is visible rather than inferred.
  --artifacts-only      Tier A only: leaked citation markup, chatbot register,
                        knowledge-cutoff hedges, unreplaced placeholders. Skips
                        every style judgement. Use this when the style catalog's
                        norms are not your norms — see "Dialect and register" in
                        the README. Cadence is still measured, never flagged.
  --list-profiles       Show discoverable profiles and exit.
  -h, --help            This text.

Exit status is 0 whenever the scan ran. This is a diagnostic, not a gate.
