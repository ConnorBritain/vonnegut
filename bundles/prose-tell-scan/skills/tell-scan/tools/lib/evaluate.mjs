 *   1. NO SINGLE PATTERN MEANS ANYTHING. Tells cluster or they are noise. A
 *      document with one "delve" has one unusual word; a document with elevated
 *      density across five independent categories has a fingerprint. So the
 *      summary counts DISTINCT categories over threshold, and never reduces to
 *      a score that could be read as a probability of AI authorship.
 *
 *   2. UNCALIBRATED IS NOT CALIBRATED. When thresholds are fallbacks rather than
 *      derived from this register's human corpus, every comparison is somebody's
 *      guess. It is labelled as one, everywhere it appears, without exception.

 * nothing read it: the loop where an author's kept edits feed back into how
 * their next draft is judged was built on the write side and dead-ended here.
 * So an ingested edit changed no output anywhere, which made the flywheel this
 * project exists for unobservable.
 *
 * BLENDED IS THE DEFAULT WHEN IT EXISTS, and that is deliberate rather than
 * convenient. Every guard that makes blending safe already ships and is tested:
 * approved samples contribute nothing below CORPUS_MINIMUM human samples, their
 * share is capped (0.2 default) and hard-clamped below 0.5 in code, and cadence
 * bands are excluded entirely. A default of human-only would leave all of that
