/**
 * relative — "is this me?"
 *
 * Compares a draft against the AUTHOR'S OWN measured rates rather than against
 * severity-band ceilings. This is the one report in the tool that answers a
 * question about a person instead of a question about text.
 *
 * WHY RATES AND NOT BANDS. The normal report asks "is this draft above the
 * ceiling for its severity class?" That ceiling is derived from a class, not
 * from the author. A writer who genuinely leans on a construction gets flagged
 * for writing like themselves; a writer who never touches it gets no signal at
 * all when a draft is suddenly full of it. `entry_rates` in the calibration file
 * is the per-author number that fixes both, and until this module existed it was
 * computed and never read.
 *
 * WHY A POISSON TEST AND NOT A RATIO. The obvious implementation compares
 * per-1k rates: "you use this 0.2x/1k, the draft is 1.4x/1k, that is 7x." On a
 * 400-word draft, ONE occurrence is 2.5x/1k. Every ratio on a short draft is
 * enormous and none of them mean anything. Treating occurrences as Poisson with
 * mean (author rate x draft words) asks the right question — "how surprised
 * should I be by this many, in a draft this long?" — and is automatically quiet
 * on short inputs, which is where a ratio is loudest and least justified.
 *
 * This is the same lesson as the min-count floor in CALIBRATION.md (FP-c, FP-d):
 * rates computed over small denominators are unstable, and the fix is not a
 * bigger threshold but a statistic that knows how much data it has.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY NOT SAY. Three different things produce "outside your range" and
 * this module cannot distinguish them: the draft drifted, the author is writing
 * something new, or the corpus is too narrow to describe them any more. Every
 * string this module emits is therefore phrased as a question. A tool that says
 * "this doesn't sound like you" when the truth is "you are stretching" teaches
 * an author to write blandly, which is the failure the whole project exists to
 * avoid. See bundles/prose-author/DESIGN.md.

 * Two occurrences of anything can happen by accident. Below this, no claim.

 * short draft. Three hits in 200 words is a pattern; three hits is also three
 * hits in 5,000 words, where the Poisson test will find it unremarkable and
 * decline on its own. The floor and the test fail in opposite directions, which
 * is why both are here.
