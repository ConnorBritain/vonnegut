/**
 * Text preparation for the deterministic scan.
 *
 * Two jobs, both of which exist to stop the scanner reporting things that are
 * not prose:
 *
 *   1. MASKING. Code blocks, inline code, URLs, link targets, and frontmatter
 *      are not writing and must not be scanned for writing tells. Masked regions
 *      are replaced with spaces rather than removed, so every character offset in
 *      the masked text still points at the same place in the original. Line
 *      numbers in findings stay honest.
 *
 *   2. SENTENCE SPLITTING. Cadence metrics are built on sentence lengths, so a
 *      splitter that breaks on "Dr." or "e.g." corrupts the single strongest
 *      signal the scanner has. Naive split-on-period is not good enough here.

 * pass. Catalog patterns spell contractions with an ASCII apostrophe — `isn't`,
 * `you're`, `it's` — while macOS, iOS, Word, and every LLM chat UI emit U+2019 by
 * default. So `chatbot-register`, a TIER A entry meant to be dispositive on one
 * occurrence, did not match "You’re absolutely right" as actually pasted. The
 * most recognisable chatbot leak there is, missed on the character it is most
 * likely to arrive with.
 *
 * Fixing it per-pattern was the wrong shape: seven entries had the bug, and the
 * eighth would arrive with the next contributor. Fixing it at intake means no
 * catalog author has to think about it again.
 *
 * STRICTLY OFFSET-PRESERVING. Every mapping is one UTF-16 code unit to one, so
 * line numbers and match offsets computed on the result are valid against the
 * original. That property is what lets the report quote the document as written
 * while matching against the folded form; see `display` in scanCatalog.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT folded: double quotes. `scanFormatting` counts curly versus
 * straight to detect paste-assembled documents, and folding them would silently
 * zero out that measurement.
