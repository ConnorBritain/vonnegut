 * which is the failure the whole bundle is organised against. So the line is
 * unconditional whenever a blend exists, not an exception report.
 *
 * The warning is the load-bearing half. `calibrate.mjs` has computed it since
 * the blend shipped and written it to thresholds.derived.json, where nothing
 * ever read it - a warning delivered to a file nobody opens. A blended ceiling
 * meaningfully TIGHTER than the human one means the approved pool has lower tell
 * density than the author's own writing, so the author's natural prose starts
 * tripping its own bands and they learn to write blander to satisfy it. That is
 * voice collapse, and it is the outcome this project exists to prevent.
