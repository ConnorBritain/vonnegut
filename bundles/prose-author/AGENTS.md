# Working in prose-author

Instructions for an agent contributing to this bundle. For what the bundle
*does*, see [`README.md`](README.md); for why it is shaped this way,
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

## The rule that is not negotiable

**The drafter never receives `catalog.json`.** Not as a prohibition list, not as
"avoid these words", not as a post-hoc hint, not behind a flag, not "just for
this register".

If you find yourself adding it because output quality would improve, stop: that
improvement is the failure. Prose optimised against a tell list scores zero and
reads like nobody wrote it, which is what the catalog exists to detect. The
target is the author's corpus and voice card. The catalog runs *afterwards*, on
the way to a human.

## Current claims and historical verification

Current runtime receipts may report only what their recorded checks support:

- explicit mechanical rules checked against the exact delivered bytes
- observed distributions compared where matching human evidence is available
- named artifact and semantic reviews completed, failed, or not evaluated

Observations are advisory, not quotas. A measured absence is not a universal
prohibition. Explicit user preferences work independently of a corpus, and
unavailable checks must never become passing checks. Semantic review does not
prove factual accuracy. Rewrites and continuation remain supported task modes;
supplied prior text is coherence/content context, never automatically a corpus
sample. Clear persistent instructions save with a visible receipt and undo;
inferred preferences need approval. Do not apply corpus-ingestion thresholds
to feedback learning.

The historical verifier's three claims remain unchanged for historical runs:

- it was scanned against this author's profile
- cadence and density were compared to this author's derived bands
- no Tier A artifact is present

Neither path claims that it **sounds like the author**, that it is **good**, or
that it would **pass a detector**. These are tested for in `tests/selftest.mjs`, including the
awkward case: the phrase "sounds like you" *does* appear in the output, inside
the sentence disclaiming it, so the test asserts every occurrence sits after
"Not claimed" rather than asserting the phrase is absent. A test written the
naive way passes for the wrong reason and would keep passing if the disclaimer
were replaced with an assertion.

## When you touch numerical history

History is opt-in and separate from both corpora and preference revisions.
Model-based rhetorical analysis needs separate consent and a separate bounded
budget. Never persist source matches, raw model outputs, or text in numerical
state. Stage measurements stay generated provenance. Unknown flags must fail
before writes; do not silently fall back from an explicit directory request.
Compare compatible contextual series, not a pooled human/generated average.
Departures are advisory and cannot independently authorize repair. Preserve
the locked bounded diagnostic as evidence; repeat only affected cases after fixes.

## When you touch exemplar selection

`tools/exemplars.mjs` is the one channel that can quietly poison a voice. Four
invariants, all tested, all with a mutation test behind them:

1. whole files, never excerpts
2. human keeps the majority — the cap is clamped below 0.5 **in code**
3. below `CORPUS_MINIMUM` human samples, approved contributes **zero**
4. approved samples order by `edit_fraction`, which is computed and never asserted

Changing any of these means changing [`PROFILES.md`](../prose-tell-scan/PROFILES.md)
in the same commit, because that file is the shared contract and two bundles
read it.

## Before you call a change here done

- `node tests/selftest.mjs`, then **`node tests/mutations.mjs`** — which applies
  every documented mutation, measures, restores, and fails if
  [`tests/MUTATIONS.md`](tests/MUTATIONS.md) disagrees with the run. If you added
  a guard, add its mutation; a guard with no failing mutation is decoration, and
  a mutation scoring 0 is reported as a missing test rather than a passing row.
  Do not hand-edit the table — `--update` regenerates it. Put the output in the PR.
- If you touched anything under `skills/`, exercise current fallback/refusal
  paths: preference-only without a corpus, limited-evidence profiles, Tier A
  artifacts, missing required siblings/adapters, scoped conflicts, interrupted
  calls and exhausted repairs. Preserve historical refusal tests as historical;
  do not reintroduce the old cold-start prohibition into current assistance.
- All four manifests parse and carry the same `version` as the marketplace entry.
- Relative links resolve — this bundle links into `prose-tell-scan` twice.

## What would make this a bad bundle

From `DESIGN.md`, repeated here because it is the checklist that matters:

- it ships with the catalog wired into drafting "just as a hint"
- it claims the output sounds like the author
- it compares against `_base` when no corpus exists, without saying so
- cadence bands get a "small" contribution from approved drafts
- `edit_fraction` becomes a field someone types
- the corpus grows faster from its own output than from the author's writing

Any one of those turns a tool that helps someone write into one that
convincingly writes like a model and tells them it is them.
