/**
 * verify — what a draft is allowed to claim about itself.
 *
 *   node verify.mjs <draft> --profile <name> [--profiles-dir <dir>] [--json]
 *
 * `kind: author` carries one obligation this repo takes literally: STATE HOW THE
 * OUTPUT WAS VERIFIED. Three things about a generated draft are checkable, and
 * those three are exactly what gets claimed:
 *
 *   1. it was scanned by tell-scan against THIS author's profile
 *   2. its cadence and density were compared to THIS author's derived bands
 *   3. any Tier A artifact is a hard failure
 *
 * And what is never claimed, in any wording, under any flag:
 *
 *   - that the draft sounds like the author        (unmeasurable)
 *   - that the draft is good                       (not this tool's business)
 *   - that it would pass any detector               (refused on principle,
 *                                                    everywhere in this repo)
 *
 * TIER A RETURNS THE DRAFT RATHER THAN REPORTING IT. A leaked citation marker,
 * a chatbot preamble, an identifier failing its own checksum - these are not
 * style observations to be weighed against a band. They are evidence the
 * generation went wrong mechanically, and handing one back with a tidy cadence
 * table beside it invites the author to read the table and skim the problem.
 *
 * THE COLD-START REFUSAL. With no calibrated corpus this reports NO GAP. It will
 * still say a draft is clean of artifacts - that is an absolute check needing no
 * corpus - but it will not compare cadence against fallback bands and let the
 * author read "within range" as "within YOUR range". Bands nobody measured are
 * this repo's guess about a generic register, and a comparison against them
 * silently means "resembles our fallback", which is a sentence about nobody.

 * Find the sibling scanner.

 * throwing ENOENT at someone who installed one plugin and not the other.
 *
 * EVERY CANDIDATE HERE IS A REAL INSTALL SHAPE, and the loose-file one was
 * missing from the first version. `install.sh` copies `skills/<name>/` flat into
 * `<dest>/skills/<name>/`, so a user who installed BOTH skills that way had the
 * scanner sitting one directory over and got "NOT VERIFIED" anyway - the
 * degradation firing while the dependency was present, which is a worse lie
 * than no check at all, because it reads as "your sibling is missing".
 *
 * Order is most-specific-first: an explicit override beats discovery, and
 * discovery prefers the shape the caller is most likely actually in.
