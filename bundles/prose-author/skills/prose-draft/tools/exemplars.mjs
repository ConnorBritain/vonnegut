/**
 * exemplars — choose what the drafter is allowed to read as style input.
 *
 *   node exemplars.mjs <profile-dir> [--target-words 800] [--n 3] [--json]
 *
 * This is the gate on the one channel that can quietly poison a voice. What the
 * drafter sees as "how this person writes" becomes what it writes, so the
 * selection rules matter more than the drafting prompt does.
 *
 * FOUR RULES, and the last two are the ones with teeth.
 *
 * 1. WHOLE FILES, NEVER EXCERPTS. A paragraph lifted out of a piece teaches the
 *    wrong thing: it shows a rhythm without showing what the rhythm was
 *    responding to. Length matching picks which whole samples to show, and never
 *    licenses cutting one down.
 *
 * 2. NEVER THE CATALOG. This tool does not read catalog.json and must not learn
 *    to. Prose optimised against a tell list scores zero and reads like nobody
 *    wrote it, which is the failure the catalog exists to DETECT, reproduced by
 *    the tool meant to prevent it. See bundles/prose-author/DESIGN.md.
 *
 * 3. HUMAN KEEPS THE MAJORITY, ALWAYS. Approved model drafts may fill at most
 *    `cap` of the exemplar slots. The cap is clamped below 0.5 in code, not in
 *    config, because a corpus where the model is the majority voice is not a
 *    setting anyone means to choose.
 *
 * 4. APPROVED SAMPLES SUPPLEMENT; THEY NEVER BOOTSTRAP. Below CORPUS_MINIMUM
 *    human samples they contribute ZERO. Otherwise the cold-start path is: fill
 *    the folder with model output, draft against model norms on day one, and
 *    never find out.
 *
 * WHY A COUNT CAP IS NOT ENOUGH, stated here because the number looks
 * reassuring and is not. Approved generations are less varied than human ones
 * twice over: the model already regressed to a mode, and the author then picked
 * the ones they liked. So 20% of slots is more than 20% of influence. The cap is
 * a floor on safety, not a guarantee of it, and that is why rule 4 exists and
 * why cadence bands never see these files at all (PROFILES.md rule 3).

 * the drift a port risks. The drift is handled instead by a contract test

 * checks that README counted as a writing sample. The cold-start refusal never
 * fired, and the drafter would have been handed the scanner's own instructional
 * boilerplate as an example of how this person writes.
