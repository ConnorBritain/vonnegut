# Three kinds of thing get installed, to three destinations:
#
#   agents/<name>.md        → <dest>/agents/<name>.md
#   skills/<name>/          → <dest>/skills/<name>/        (whole directory)
#   commands/<name>.md      → <dest>/commands/<name>.md
#
# A command copied loose is invoked as /<name>; installed as part of a plugin it
# is namespaced /<plugin>:<name>. Commands here are written to delegate to their
# skill rather than to invoke bundled scripts through ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT},
# which is what lets them survive a loose install — that variable only resolves
# under a plugin. A command that shells out to a plugin path directly would need
# the plugin install:
#
#   /plugin marketplace add ConnorBritain/agent-primitives
#   /plugin install <bundle>@agent-primitives
#
# Skills carry their own tooling by relative path, so they work either way.
#
# Installed is not the same as wired: some primitives are dispatcher-triggered,
# others need a CLAUDE.md rule. See docs/wiring.md.
